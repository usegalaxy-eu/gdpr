## Definitions

European Galaxy Sites or "the Galaxy Service": any one of the Galaxy sites provided to you by the Freiburg Galaxy Team and the European Galaxy Project, including but not limited to:

- https://usegalaxy.eu

## Use of Service.

The European Galaxy Sites and UseGalaxy Site are a free, public, Internet
accessible resource (the "Service"). Data transfer is encrypted unless you
choose to use unencrypted FTP access. Data storage is not encrypted. If there
are restrictions on the way your research data can be stored and used, please
consult your local institutional review board or the project principal
investigator before uploading it to any public site, including this Service. If
you have protected data, large data storage requirements, or short deadlines
you are encouraged to set up your own local Galaxy instance and not use this
Service. Your access to the service may be revoked at any time for reasons
deemed necessary by the operators of the Service.

You are strictly prohibited from making use of the Galaxy Service for the
storage or processing of any Personal Data or Sensitive Personal Data as
defined by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
including but not limited to potentially personally identifying medical data.

## Accounts and Service Limitations

You may choose to register an account with the Service. Your registration data
is primarily used so you may persistently store data on the Service and use
advanced Galaxy features such as sharing and workflows. The operators of the
Service will not provide your registration data to any third party unless
required to do so by law. Your access to the Service is provided under the
condition that you abide by any published quotas on data storage, job
submissions, or any other limitations placed on the public Service. Attempts to
subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or through any other method
may result in termination of all associated accounts.

## Disclaimer

The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service agreement.

## Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg
im Breisgau or any other entity which provides resources for the Service be
liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this Service
including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable
law prohibits such limitation.
