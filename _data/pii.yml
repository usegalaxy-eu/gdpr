          We store the data securely in our database which only the
          UseGalaxy.eu administrators have access to.

          We perform automated security scans on job data to protect our systems against
          malicious software. The scans happen on our servers and no data is
          transmitted.

          Additionaly, pseudonymized data is shared publicly for analysis by
          the Galaxy Project in order to optimise job scheduling and memory
          allocation, allowing us to run more jobs per node than we used to.
