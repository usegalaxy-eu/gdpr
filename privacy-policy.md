We may use this information in anonymised aggregates in order to generate usage statistics and to improve the usefulness of our services. The data related to people is discarded after 24 hours.

### Purpose and legal basis

The system needs to temporarily store the user’s IP address to enable the website to be sent to the user’s computer. The user’s IP address must be retained for the duration of the session. The data are stored in a log file as a means of ensuring the proper functioning of the website. <!--In addition, we use the data to optimize the website and guarantee the security of our information technology systems. The IP addresses included in the log entries are not combined with other retained data unless there are actual indications that there has been a disruption of proper operation.--> These purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in processing data in accordance with § 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

Beyond this, we will only store personal information which you provide to us voluntarily (e.g. datasets uploaded to Galaxy, histories you create, etc.), or as part of a support request.

The information required to register with the European Galaxy Sites and all uploaded data is solely used to offer the services provided by the Galaxy Freiburg Team. Username and email address are mandatory for registering with this service. This information is required to guarantee the legitimate use of the service and to prevent duplicate registrations abusing our quota system.

For the European Galaxy Sites you can see all of the information we have stored related to your person and you have the right to correct this information at any time. For the Galaxy service you may do this by going to https://usegalaxy.eu, clicking on "User" → "Preferences" → "Manage Information". You also have the right to retract your consent to use personal identifiable information at any time with effect for the future. An email to the address stated below is sufficient. We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above.


<!-- In the case that investigative measures are initiated due to attacks on our information technology system, the data and log files named above may be passed on to state investigative bodies (e.g., police, public prosecutor). The same applies if these bodies or courts direct inquiries at the university and the university is obligated to comply with them. -->

<!--Law enforcement requests came from time to time. I would foresee that.-->


<!-- The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of data collected to make the website available, this is the case at the end of the relevant session. The data retained in log files are deleted after seven days. -->

<!-- Do you have a retention policy? Should be considered, because the deletion of no longer used data is a crucial part of the GDPR-->
