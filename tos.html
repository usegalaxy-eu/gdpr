          <h2 id="use-of-service">Use of Service</h2>

<p>The European Galaxy Sites and UseGalaxy Site are a free, public, Internet-accessible
resource (the “Service”). Data transfer is encrypted unless you
choose to use unencrypted FTP access. Data storage is not encrypted. If there
are restrictions on the way your research data can be stored and used, please
consult your local institutional review board or the project principal
investigator before uploading it to any public site, including this Service. If
you have protected data, large data storage requirements, or short deadlines
you are encouraged to set up your own local Galaxy instance and not use this
Service. Your access to the service may be revoked at any time for reasons
deemed necessary by the operators of the Service. This includes, but is not limited
to users who exploit our systems, by e.g. using our services for purposes that are
not related to science, research and education in the broadest sense, but e.g. by executing
software that leverages compute resources for the sole purpose of generating revenue.
When our systems detect abusive behavior originating from your account, 
we might disable your account automatically and inform you by email about the action
and your possibilities to lodge an objection. This automated process is required to protect
our systems and a manual process would not cope with the speed of the operations.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance of all of your data
processing activities carried out on the Galaxy Service with applicable laws
and regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Union, as well
as any laws or regulations of other legislations or any other restrictions that
might be applicable due to the provenance, intended use, legal ownership of or
any licensing or other legal restrictions imposed on the data being processed.</p>

<p>Usegalaxy.eu is hosted out of an ISO 27001 certified data center operated by the
<a href="https://www.rz.uni-freiburg.de/en?set_language=en">University of Freiburg IT Services</a>
and does its due diligence to ensure information security and data protection.
However, this does not consitute a warranty for fitness for any particular purpose.
You, the end user, bear the full responsibility for the implications of using our
services. You are strictly prohibited from making use of the Galaxy Service for
running non-scientific cryptography applications, storing and/or processing
any data obtained from illegitimate sources, or any other activities that are
categorized as a (cyber) crime with respect to the laws of Germany or EU.</p>

<h2 id="accounts-and-service-limitations">Accounts and Service Limitations</h2>

<p>You may choose to register an account with the Service. Your registration data
is primarily used so you may persistently store data on the Service and use
advanced Galaxy features such as sharing and workflows. The operators of the
Service will not provide your registration data to any third party, unless
required to do so by law. Your access to the Service is provided under the
condition that you abide by any published quotas on data storage, job
submissions, or any other limitations placed on the public Service. Attempts to
subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or through any other method
may result in termination of all associated accounts.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The Service is provided to you on an “AS IS” BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service agreement.</p>

<h2 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg
im Breisgau or any other entity which provides resources for the Service be
liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this Service
including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable
law prohibits such limitation.</p>
